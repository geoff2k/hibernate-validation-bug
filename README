Composed constraints lose the payload information of the constraints they are
composed of.

If you annotate a customer with the following constraint:

@ValidCustomer
public class Customer { ... }

And the ValidCustomer constraint is composed of a @NameMustBeGeoff constraint
that has a payload:

@NameMustBeGeoff(payload = Error.class)

When the violation is returned, even though the violation will be from the
NameMustBeGeoff annotation, the payload defined for NameMustBeGeoff will be
lost.
